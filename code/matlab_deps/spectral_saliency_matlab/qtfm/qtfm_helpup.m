% This file is provided to enable refreshing of HTML help files from the
% Start menu. Master help files for QTFM functions are stored in the
% directory helpfiles/xmlfiles, and it is these files that are stored on
% the CVS repository. Whenever a CVS update is done, the HTML files must be
% regenerated from the XML masters. (This is only necessary for people who
% update from CVS, since each major release will include already-generated
% HTML files.) This code is based on that used to call the test code (q.v.
% for a more detailed rationale for its operation.)
