function [U,S,V] = svdj(A, tol)
% SVDJ Singular value decomposition using Jacobi algorithm.

% Copyright © 2005, 2006 Nicolas Le Bihan and Stephen J. Sangwine.

% This function works for real, complex or quaternion matrices.
%
% Arguments: A    - a real, complex or quaternion matrix.
%            tol  - a tolerance, defaults to eps if omitted.
% Returns:   U, V - singular vectors (unitary matrices).
%            S    - singular values.
%
% The singular value decomposition computed by this function is the same as
% that computed by the function svd.m, but this code, being based on a
% cyclic Jacobi algorithm, is more accurate. However, it is also slower.
% It is intended as a reference implementation since the Jacobi algorithm
% is known to be the most accurate SVD algorithm.
%
% This function will work on real, complex and quaternion matrices.

% In what follows we need to be able to construct a quaternion or real or
% complex matrix according to the type of the actual supplied for the
% parameter A. This is a tricky bit of programming, but the key to it is
% the concept of function handles (see Matlab Help). This permits us to
% call the constructor function for the type of A, which is double in the
% case of real or complex A, quaternion if A is quaternion.

% implicit matrix B = A' * A. This sum is invariant and we do not
% need to calculate it again. We normalise it by the matrix size.
