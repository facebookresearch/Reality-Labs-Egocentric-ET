if isreal(X)
    
    % X is a real quaternion, and we compute the square root of an
    % isomorphic complex number using the standard Matlab square root
    % function, then construct a quaternion with the same axis as the
    % original quaternion.
    
    Y = isoquaternion(sqrt(isocomplex(X)), X);
else
    
    % X is a complex quaternion, and therefore we cannot use the method
    % above for real quaternions, because it is not possible to construct
    % an isomorphic complex number. Therefore we use polar form and halve
    % the argument. Note that the modulus and argument here are complex,
    % so the square root of the modulus is complex.
    
    % Preconstruct a result array of zero quaternions, of the same size as
    % X and with components of the same class.
    
    Y = zerosq(size(X), class(x(X)));
    
    % If the vector part of any element of X is zero, computing its axis
    % will result in an undefined axis warning. We avoid this warning by
    % computing just the square root of the scalar part in these cases.
    % There may be no such cases, or all the elements in X may have
    % undefined axis.
    
    undefined = abs(normq(v(X))) < eps;
    defined   = ~undefined;
        
    % In order to perform the subscripted assignment using the logical 
    % array undefined we have to use subsasgn and substruct because normal
    % indexing does not work here in a class method.
    % See the file 'implementation notes.txt', item 8, for more details.

% There is a formula given in the following book, which may be worth
% investigation. It is: Y = (1 + X) ./ sqrt(2 .* (1 + X.w)). Notice this
% requires adding 1 to the scalar part, and then dividing by a real value.
% The formula is valid only for unit quaternions, so an adjustment would be
% needed to handle the general case.
