function Y = iqfft(X, A, L)
% IQFFT Inverse Discrete quaternion Fourier transform.
%
% This function calculates the inverse fast quaternion Fourier transform
% of (columns of) X. A specifies the transform axis (that is the direction
% in 3-space of the vector part of the hypercomplex exponential). It must
% be a pure quaternion (real or complex) but it need not have unit modulus.
% L specifies whether the quaternion exponential is on the left ('L') or
% right ('R').

    S = -1;  % S is a sign bit used (in effect) to conjugate one of the complex
             % components below when the exponential is on the right.  In fact,
             % instead of conjugating the exponential (which would require an
             % inverse fft (ifft), we conjugate the complex component before and 
             % after the transformation. This achieves the same effect because
             % the inverse transform may always be computed by taking the
             % conjugate before and after the transformation (this is a
             % standard DFT trick).

% Compute the transform. This is done by changing the basis of all the
% elements of the matrix or vector X to the transform axis (which may be
% real or complex). The quaternion elements can then be regrouped as
% complex values and their FFTs computed with the standard Matlab function.
% We then have to regroup the complex results into quaternion form and
% invert the change of basis.

% Note that we compute here a real quaternion FFT (two complex FFTs) if
% both X and the axis are real, otherwise we compute a complex quaternion
% FFT (four complex FFTs). The decision is made after the change of basis,
% because by this point, if X is still real, a real quaternion FFT is
% needed. It is theoretically possible to use the complex code for both
% cases, but in the real case this would result in two unnecessary FFTs
% being computed, which is a heavy cost.
