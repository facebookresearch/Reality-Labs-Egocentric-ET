% ORTHONORMAL_BASIS creates an orthonormal basis from a pure quaternion V,
% and an optional pure quaternion W, which need not be perpendicular to V,
% but must not be parallel.

% The result is represented as a 3 by 3 orthogonal matrix, which may be
% complex if V and/or W are complex pure quaternions.

% the complex case. However, we cannot leave it with non-unit modulus,

% It is possible for the result to be numerically inaccurate, and therefore

% TODO: Consider an alternative method based on rotation of the standard
% basis. Given V, compute a rotation that rotates qi to V. Apply the same
% rotation to qj and qk, and you have a new basis which is bound to be
% orthogonal. The role of W in this needs to be thought out. Do we really
% need it? The rotation from V to qi must be computed around the axis
% perpendicular to the plane containing V and qi. This is easily done by
% computing q = scalar_product(V, qi) + vector_product(V, qi), then p =
% sqrt(q). The rotation is then conj(p).*qi.p to get V, and similarly with
% qj and qk to get the other two axes. This method won't work with
% nilpotents, but maybe this is not a limitation, since the method
% currently used also suffers from this problem.
