function R = inv(a)
% INV   Inverse of a quaternion (matrix).
% (Quaternion overloading of standard Matlab function.)
%
% For a single quaternion, this function computes the inverse,
% that is the conjugate divided by the modulus. The result will
% be a NaN if the quaternion has zero modulus. For matrices it
% computes the matrix inverse using an analytical formula based
% on partitioning the matrix into sub-matrices. A better method
% may be substituted in the future.

if r == 1 % c must also be 1, since we have checked that r == c above.

    % We handle the 2 by 2 case separately since this can be computed
    % using quaternion products, rather than quaternion matrix products.

    A = subsref(a, substruct('()', {1,1})); % A = a(1,1);
    B = subsref(a, substruct('()', {1,2})); % B = a(1,2);
    C = subsref(a, substruct('()', {2,1})); % C = a(2,1);

    IA = inv(A); % If A is zero, this will cause a NaN and the whole
                 % result will be NaNs. Solution unknown as yet.

    IAB = IA .* B; % These two subexpressions are needed more than
    CIA = C .* IA; % once each, and are computed once for efficiency.

    T  = inv(D - CIA .* B);

    TCIA = T .* CIA; % This is needed twice, so compute it once and reuse.

    % For matrices larger than 2 by 2, we partition the matrix into sub
    % blocks of half the height/width of the input matrix. If the input
    % matrix has an even number of rows (and therefore columns,  since it
    % is square),  then the sub-blocks will be exactly half the height
    % (width),  otherwise the left block will have one less element,
    % because we round towards zero. The layout of the sub-blocks is:
    %
    %                 [ A B ]
    %                 [ C D ]
    %
    % the same as in the 2 by 2 case above (except that here they are
    % matrices and not scalars).

    p = fix(r./2); % Calculate half the number of rows/columns rounded down.
    q = p + 1;     % Index of first element of right or bottom block.

    A = subsref(a, substruct('()', {1:p, 1:p})); % A = a(1:p, 1:p);
    B = subsref(a, substruct('()', {1:p, q:c})); % B = a(1:p, q:c);
    C = subsref(a, substruct('()', {q:r, 1:p})); % C = a(q:r, 1:p);
    D = subsref(a, substruct('()', {q:r, q:c})); % D = a(q:r, q:c);

    IA = inv(A);

    IAB = IA * B; % These two subexpressions are needed more than
    CIA = C * IA; % once each, and are computed once for efficiency.

    T  = inv(D - CIA * B);

    TCIA = T * CIA; % This is needed twice, so compute it once and reuse.

    R = [[IA + IAB * TCIA, -IAB * T];...
         [          -TCIA,        T]];
