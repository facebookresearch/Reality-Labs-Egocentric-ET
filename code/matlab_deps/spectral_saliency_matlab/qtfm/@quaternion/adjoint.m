function C = adjoint(A, F, B)
% ADJOINT   Computes an adjoint matrix of the quaternion matrix A. The
% adjoint matrix has 'equivalent' properties to the original matrix (for
% example, singular values).
%
% adjoint(A) or
% adjoint(A, 'complex')    returns a complex adjoint matrix.
% adjoint(A, 'real')       returns a real    adjoint matrix.
% adjoint(A, 'quaternion') returns a quaternion adjoint (A must be a
%                          biquaternion matrix in this case).
%
% The third parameter (which may appear in the second position if the
% second is omitted), controls the layout of the adjoint, specifically
% whether the adjoint is organised in blocks by components (scalar, x, y,
% z) or with each quaternion represented as an adjoint block.
%
% adjoint(A, 'block')      returns a complex matrix with each quaternion
%                          represented by a 2-by-2 block.
% adjoint(A, 'real', 'block') returns a real adjoint matrix in which each
%                             quaternion is represented by a real adjoint 
%                             block, and similarly for other cases.
%
% There is no opposite for 'block'. 'block' is not supported with the
% option 'quaternion'.
%
% The definition of the adjoint matrix is not unique (several permutations
% of the layout are possible).

% Note: in the case of a biquaternion matrix, the three cases 'complex',
% 'real' and 'quaternion' do not cover all the possibilities, and the
% option strings are not accurately descriptive (since the 'real' adjoint
% actually has complex elements). Two more possibilities can be obtained by
% a double call on this function, and to make clear what the possibilities
% are, they are listed below:
%
% adjoint(b, 'complex') gives a 2x2 complex block per element of b. This is
% not simple as the elements of the adjoint are a mix of the elements of b,
% but it works.
%
% adjoint(b, 'real') gives a 4x4 complex block per element of b. In this
% case the values in the 4x4 block are copies of the four complex elements
% of b.
%
% adjoint(b, 'quaternion') gives a 2x2 quaternion block per element of b.
% This adjoint can be further processed (since the result is a quaternion
% matrix) to give two more adjoints of b, as listed below.
%
% adjoint(adjoint(b, 'quaternion'), 'complex') gives a 4x4 complex block
% per element of b, but not the same complex values as above - the real and
% imaginary parts are swapped around.
%
% adjoint(adjoint(b, 'quaternion'), 'real') gives an 8x8 real block per
% element of b, where the elements of the block are elements of b, but with
% changes of sign.
%
% The last two cases might merit further study.

% Note 2. The 'quaternion' adjoint requires further study. The alternative
% line of code at 138 above is under study - there are possible
% compatibility issues between the various different adjoints, particularly
% for biquaternions. A matching change is needed in unadjoint.m of course.

% Note 3. In the case of a quaternion matrix (i.e. not a singleton
% quaternion), it is possible to construct the adjoint in two ways, quite
% apart from the permutations of layout mentioned above. These two ways are
% as above, with the quaternion matrix inserted in blocks into the adjoint
% (with negation and so on applied to the blocks); or in an interleaved
% form in which the blocks are distributed so that each quaternion is
% inserted into the adjoint as a block matrix following the pattern given
% above. For example, a quaternion matrix [q1, q2; q3, q4] could be
% assembled into an adjoint like this:
%
% [adjoint(q1), adjoint(q2); ...
%  adjoint(q3), adjoint(q4)]
%
% and this is what is returned by the 'block' option.
