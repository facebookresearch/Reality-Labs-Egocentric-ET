function q = compose(a,b,c,d)
% Private function to compose a quaternion from four components.

% The rationale for using this function is that it, and the five private
% functions ess(), exe(), wye(), zed() and vee() should be the only
% functions that have knowledge of the underlying representation of a
% quaternion in order to minimise the changes necessary to use a different
% representation. In particular, the class constructor function uses this
% function to make a quaternion, so that even the constructor does not
% know how a quaternion is represented.
