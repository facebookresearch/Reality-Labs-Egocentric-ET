function Y = qfft2(X, A, L)
% QFFT2 Discrete 2D quaternion Fourier transform.
%
% This function calculates the fast quaternion 2D Fourier transform of X.
% The second parameter, A, specifies the transform axis (that is the
% direction in 3-space of the vector part of the hypercomplex exponential).
% It must be a pure quaternion (real or complex) but it need not have unit
% modulus. L specifies whether the quaternion exponential is on the left
% ('L') or right ('R').

             % instead of conjugating the exponential (which would require an
             % inverse fft (ifft), we conjugate the complex component before and 
             % after the transformation. This achieves the same effect because
             % the inverse transform may always be computed by taking the
             % conjugate before and after the transformation (this is a
             % standard DFT trick).

% Compute the transform. This is done by changing the basis of all the
% elements of the matrix or vector X to the transform axis (which may be
% real or complex). The quaternion elements can then be regrouped as
% complex values and their FFTs computed with the standard Matlab function.
% We then have to regroup the complex results into quaternion form and
% invert the change of basis.

% Note that we compute here a real quaternion FFT (two complex FFTs) if
% both X and the axis are real, otherwise we compute a complex quaternion
% FFT (four complex FFTs). The decision is made after the change of basis,
% because by this point, if X is still real, a real quaternion FFT is
% needed. It is theoretically possible to use the complex code for both
% cases, but in the real case this would result in two unnecessary FFTs
% being computed, which is a heavy cost.
