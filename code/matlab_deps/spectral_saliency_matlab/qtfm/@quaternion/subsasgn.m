    % Possible use of structure indexing is to implement the following
    % sorts of assignment:
    %
    % q.x = blah
    %
    % However, there are some issues to be considered before implementing
    % such a scheme. Would it work, for example, if q doesn't exist? What
    % should happen if q is pure and q.s = blah occurs? Should q become a
    % full quaternion, or should an error be raised? What about mixed use
    % of array indexing and structure indexing, e.g. q.x(:,1)? Would it
    % work for q.x = q.x .* 2 where the structure indexing occurs on the
    % right hand side as well as on the left. Guess: q.x on the right would
    % be handled by subsref, not subsassgn.
