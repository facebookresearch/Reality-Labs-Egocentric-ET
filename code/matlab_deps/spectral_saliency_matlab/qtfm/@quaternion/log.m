    % complex number using the standard Matlab log function, then construct
    % a quaternion with the same axis as the original quaternion.

    % above for real quaternions, because it is not possible to construct

% Appendix.
%
% The calculation of log(X) is not difficult to derive, as follows.
%
% First note that exp(Y) = X (definition of logarithm). Then write
% X in polar form as r .* exp(mu .* theta). Then we have:
%
% log(X) = Y = log(r) + log(exp(mu .* theta)) = log(r) + mu .* theta.
% 
% Rather than calculate r = abs(X), we use normq because this
% avoids calculating a square root. We compensate by halving log(r).
% mu and theta are obtained using the axis and angle functions. Note
% that we don't need to add the two results, since the first is a
% real or complex value, and the second is a pure quaternion (real
% or complex). Therefore we can compose them using the quaternion
% constructor function.
