   % The problem is that the singular vectors (U and V) are not unitary and
   % even the singular values may be wrong, despite the fact that
   % U * S * V' is a correct reconstruction of X.
   % The following article may be of relevance to this issue,
   % and it may require the functon bidiagonalize to be modified.

% The method used is to bidiagonalize X using Householder transformations
% to obtain H, B, and G where B is a real or complex bidiagonal matrix, and
% H and G are the products of the Householder matrices used to compute B.
% Then: H' * B * G' = X. If X is pure we provide a zero scalar part to
% prevent problems in the bidiagonalization.

if ispure(X)
    [H, B, G] = bidiagonalize(zeros(size(X), class(X.x)) + X);
else
    [H, B, G] = bidiagonalize(X);
end

% The second step is to compute the SVD of B using the standard Matlab
% routine, for a real or complex matrix (which happens to be bidiagonal).

if nargout == 0

    % The econ parameter is passed to the Matlab svd routine, even though
    % it appears to have no effect if there is no output parameter, since
    % only the singular values are output, and they are output as a column
    % vector.

    % In this case, the econ parameter has been given, but if we were to
    % pass it to the Matlab svd routine, the returned U and V matrices
    % would not be compatible with H and G. Therefore, we don't pass it,
    % but after multiplying the results by H and G, we truncate them to
    % give the economy mode result, so that the result is compatible with
    % that produced by the standard Matlab svd function.

                     % must use ' and not .' here. (H and G are
                     % quaternion-valued, and therefore H' means a
                     % quaternion transpose conjugate.)
