% This function cannot be implemented using the Matlab cumprod function,
% which is a built-in function, because a quaternion product cannot be
% computed componentwise.

% In what follows, we need to use subscripted references, but these do not
% work inside a class method (which this is). See the file 'implementation
% notes.txt', item 8.

    % There is no dim parameter, so if the input is a vector, we can just
    % multiply all the elements together, if it is a matrix or array, we
    % need to work on the columns,....
    
    % The result has the same size as the argument, so we start by making a
    % copy. However, since A could be a pure quaternion array, and the
    % result cannot be pure in general, we must force X to be a full
    % quaternion array. A simple way to do this is to add zeros (to the
    % scalar part). The class function here is used to ensure that the
    % zeros have the same type as the components of A, so that if, for
    % example, A is a quaternion with int8 components, the array of zeros
    % will be of type int8.
    
    X = zeros(size(A), class(A.x)) + A;
               
    % We then have to work along the copy, at each index value multiplying
    % on the left by the product of all the previous elements, which we
    % keep in P, to simplify the subsref/subsasgn calls.
