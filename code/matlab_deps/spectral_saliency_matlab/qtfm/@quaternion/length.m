% This was written because length appears not to work correctly for arrays
% of structs, as can be demonstrated by:
%
% a.x = randn(5,1), length(a)
%
% which gives 1, and
%
% a = randn(5,1), length(a)
%
% which gives 5, as expected.

error(nargchk(1, 1, nargin)), error(nargoutchk(0, 1, nargout))

% We use the length of the x component, not the length of the scalar part,
% since if q is pure, there is no scalar part.

n = length(q.x);
