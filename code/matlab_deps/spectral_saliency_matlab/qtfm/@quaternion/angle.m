function theta = angle(q, a)
% ANGLE or phase of quaternion.
% (Quaternion overloading of standard Matlab function.)
%
% The second parameter is optional. If omitted, the result will always be
% in the range (0, pi), that is, the quaternion q is regarded as being in
% the upper half of a complex plane defined by the axis of q. A reference
% unit vector defining the direction of the positive imaginary axis of q
% may be supplied as the second parameter, in which case the result may
% be in the full range from -pi to +pi. This reference unit vector is used
% to define the north pole of a hemisphere of 3-space, so that if the axis
% of q lies in this hemisphere, the angle is in the range (0,pi). If the
% axis of q lies in the other (southern) hemisphere, then the angle
% returned will lie in (pi, 2*pi).
%
% The optional argument must be either the same size as q or be a scalar
% (in which case the same value is used for all elements of q).

% Appendix: calculation of arctangent(y, x) when y and x are complex.
%
% Algorithms for computing the arctangent (or arcsin/arccos) of a complex
% value are given in some books on complex analysis e.g. (Mathews, 1982).
%
% The algorithm used here can be derived using the method given in Mathews'
% book, as follows. We are given x and y, both complex, and these are the
% sine and cosine of theta (also complex), respectively.
% Therefore, tan(theta) = y/x. The sine and cosine of a complex angle can
% be written in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's identities
% (Penguin Dictionary of Mathematics, 2003):
%
% sin(theta) = (1/2i)[exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta)]
% cos(theta) = (1/2) [exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)]
%
% Therefore, we can write:
%
% y/x = sin(theta)/cos(theta)
%     = [exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta)]/i[exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)]
%
% Multiplying numerator and denominator on the right by exp(i theta)
% this simplifies to:
%
% y/x = [exp(2i theta) - 1]/i[exp(2i theta) + 1]
%
% and cross multiplying and gathering all terms on the left, and
% multiplying through by -1, we get:
%
% => exp(2i theta)[x - iy] - [x + iy] = 0
%
% => exp(2i theta) = [x + iy]/[x - iy]
%
% Rationalizing the right-hand side we obtain:
%
% exp(2i theta) = [x+iy]^2 / [x^2 + y^2]
%
% Taking the square root of both sides:
%
% exp(i theta) = [x + iy]/sqrt[x^2 + y^2]
%
% Finally, taking the natural logarithm of both sides and multiplying
% throughout by i, we get:
%
% theta = -i ln[(x + iy)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2)]
