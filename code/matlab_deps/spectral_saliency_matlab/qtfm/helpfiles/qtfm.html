<h1>Quaternion Toolbox</h1>
<p>
The quaternion toolbox for Matlab&reg; (QTFM for short) extends
Matlab&reg; to handle vectors and matrices of quaternions.
Many quaternion-specific functions are implemented, as are overloadings of
standard Matlab&reg; functions and Matlab&reg; operators and notation.
The toolbox is intended to work as far as possible in the same way as Matlab&reg; itself.
Most functions are vectorized, and where a Matlab&reg; function is overloaded
by the toolbox, as far as possible the quaternion function accepts the same
parameters as the Matlab&reg; function.
</p>
<p>
The toolbox includes test code which can be invoked from the Matlab&reg;
Start menu, or by running the test function itself (in the subdirectory
<tt>test</tt>).
</p>
<p>
For a general overview of quaternions, and how they are handled by the
toolbox, see the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> page.
For a detailed list of functions, see the
<a href="alphabetical.html">alphabetical</a> or
<a href="categorical.html">categorized</a> lists.
</p>
<p>
Many Matlab&reg; functions will work with quaternion arrays, because all
the functions called are overloaded by the toolbox, and the semantics of
the quaternion version are consistent with what the Matlab&reg; function
expects. A <a href="matlist.html">list of these functions</a> is available.
</p>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
The toolbox website and Sourceforge project page may be acccessed from the
Matlab&reg; Start menu, or from the following links:<br>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="http://qtfm.sourceforge.net/">Web site at Sourceforge</a>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtfm/">Sourceforge project page</a>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Matlab&reg; version required</h2>
<p>
Matlab&reg; Version 7.4 (R2007a) is the minimum recommended system to run
the toolbox. The test code (see below) verifies this version and documents
the reasons for requiring it.
</p>
<h2>GNU Octave compatibility (under development)</h2>
<p>
From version 1.8 onwards, we have introduced some minor changes to attempt
to achieve compatibility with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a>.
At present, the toolbox will not work correctly under GNU Octave.
The test code (see below) will recognise that QTFM is running under Octave,
but the tests will fail due to serious problems with the GNU Octave search
path, and the lack of recognition by GNU Octave of the toolbox directory
structure. We welcome contributions to fixing these problems, which will be
acknowledged on the <a href="contrib.html">contributors page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Test code</h2>
<p>
Some test code is provided in the directory <tt>test</tt>.
To run it set the working directory to <tt>qtfm/test</tt>
and type <tt>test</tt> in the command window. This runs all the test
code. Alternatively, there is a menu item accessible from the Matlab
Start menu which will run the test code. There may be some warnings
about numerical accuracy of results, which vary from one test run to
the next, and can usually be ignored.
</p>
<h2>CVS Repository</h2>
<p>
We use CVS for version control of files within the toolbox, and new versions
of files are uploaded to the CVS repository at Sourceforge as we develop
them, in between releases of the toolbox. If you wish, you should be able
to set up your own CVS system to provide read-only access to the repository
and thus keep the toolbox updated in between releases. The effort of doing
this is not likely to be worthwhile unless you already know how to use CVS.
</p>
<p>
However, it may sometimes be worthwhile to check for a newer version of a
specific file, if you hit a problem. You can do this through a web interface
to the CVS repository:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://qtfm.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qtfm/">Browse CVS repository</a>
at Sourceforge.
</ul>
