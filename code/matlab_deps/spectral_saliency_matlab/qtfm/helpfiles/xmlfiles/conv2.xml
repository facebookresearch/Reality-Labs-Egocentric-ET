<para>
<code>conv2(A, B)</code> computes the two-dimensional convolution of matrices
<code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. It operates in a similar way to the
standard &matlab; function
apart from supporting both left and right coefficients. (Since quaternion
multiplication is not commutative, the general case requires both left
and right multiplication in the convolution product/summation.) The
&matlab; function allows the first two parameters to be vectors - this is
not implemented as yet. Acceptable calling profiles are:
<pre>
C = conv2(A, B)      - A is convolved on the left of B, that is A * B
C = conv2({L, R}, B) - The convolution is L * B * R. L and R must be of
                       the same size.
</pre>
An optional last parameter can specify 'shape' as for the standard Matlab
function. This is currently not implemented.
