<para>
This function implements the elementwise binary addition operator for
quaternion arrays.
It is implemented
for both full and pure quaternions and will implicitly supply a zero scalar
part when needed. It also will work where one of the operands is not a
quaternion, for example to add a real or complex value to a quaternion
(implicitly to the scalar part).
</para>
<para>
The left and right parameters must have components of the same class, or if
one is numeric, it must have the same class as the components of the other
(which must be a quaternion). It is not possible, for example, to add a
matrix of <code>uint8</code> unsigned integers to a pure quaternion matrix
with components of type <code>double</code>. This is to prevent the creation
of a quaternion matrix with components of mixed class, which would cause
problems in other functions.
