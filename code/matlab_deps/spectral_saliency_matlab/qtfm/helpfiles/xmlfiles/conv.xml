<code>conv(A, B)</code> computes the one-dimensional convolution of
<code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. It operates in the same way as the
overloaded &matlab; function, except that it provides a mechanism to
support both left and right coefficients. (Since quaternion
multiplication is not commutative, the general case requires both left
and right multiplication in the convolution product/summation.) To supply
left and right coefficients, use the calling profile <code>conv({L,R},v)</code>
where <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> are vectors of the same length and
orientation. If the first parameter is not a cell array, it is taken to be
a left coefficient and the right coefficient array is implicitly ones.
