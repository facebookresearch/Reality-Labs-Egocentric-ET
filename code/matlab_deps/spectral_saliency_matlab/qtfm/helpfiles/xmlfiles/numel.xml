<code>numel(X)</code> overloads a &matlab; function with subtle internal
uses. It plays a role in subscripted indexing, and although its name suggests
that it returns the number of elements in an array, this function DOES NOT
return the number of quaternions in the array <code>X</code>. This can be
obtained easily by <code>prod(size(q))</code>. The reason for
this is complex, but connected with the way &matlab; implements subscripted
indexing. See the notes in the &matlab; documentation for the <code>numel</code>
function. (This function was changed in May 2008. Prior to this date, it
did return <code>prod(size(q))</code> but this was incompatible with
correct working of other functions.)
