<short>3D scatter plot from quaternion array.</short>
<syntax>scatter3(q, varargin)</syntax>
<long>
    <para>
        <code>scatter3</code> plots a 3D scatter plot of elements in a 
        pure quaternion vector. It supports the same parameter profiles as
        the &matlab; function of the same name, except that the first three
        parameters <code>(X, Y, Z)</code> are replaced by a single
        quaternion parameter, which must be a pure quaternion vector.
    </para>
    <para>
        If two parameters are given and the second is 'rgb' or 'seq', a
        coloured scatter plot is produced. 'rgb' colours the plotted points
        according to the direction of the position vector of the point from 
        the origin using the convention of X = red, Y = green and Z = blue
        (the standard RGB colour space used in image processing).
        This is useful when the spatial position
        of points is of interest. 'seq' colours the points in a graded sequence
        of progressively darker values matching the sequence of points in the
        quaternion vector Q. This is useful when the ordering of the points is of
        interest.
    </para>
    <para>
        If more than one <code>varargin</code> parameter is given, or the first is
        neither 'rgb' nor 'seq', the <code>varargin</code> parameters are passed to the Matlab
        scatter3 function, and must therefore conform to the requirements of that
        function.
    </para>
    <para>
        For more sophisticated requirements, use the Matlab function
        and pass the X, Y and Z components of the quaternion array as the
        first three parameters.
