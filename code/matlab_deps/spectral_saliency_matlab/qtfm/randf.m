function S = randf(mu, kappa, varargin)
% RANDF   Returns unit vectors (pure quaternions) distributed on the sphere
% according to a Fisher distribution (a special case of the more general
% von Mises-Fisher distributions). See also RANDVMF for the 4-sphere case.
%
% The first parameter must be a pure quaternion, defining the direction of
% the centre of the distribution. The second parameter is the concentration
% parameter which controls the spread of the distribution on the sphere. It
% must be non-negative. A value of zero results in a uniform distribution
% on the sphere. Larger values result in greater concentration of the
% distribution in the mean direction mu.
%
% The remaining parameters are as for the Matlab function rand (q.v.).  The
% result may be scalar, vector, matrix or array depending on the parameters
% supplied.  Each pure quaternion returned is the result of at least two
% calls on rand, and two calls on randn, and hence randf modifies the state
% of the generator used by both rand and randn. To initialise the generator
% or control the choice of generator, use rand and/or randn.

% the inverse on the right and not the conjugate.
