function S = randvmf(mu, kappa, varargin)
% RANDVMF   Returns unit quaternions distributed on the 4-sphere according
% to a von Mises-Fisher distribution. See also RANDF for the 3-sphere case.
%
% The first parameter, mu, must be a full quaternion, defining the
% direction of the centre of the distribution in 4-space. The second
% parameter is the concentration parameter which controls the spread of the
% distribution on the sphere. It must be non-negative. A value of zero
% results in a uniform distribution on the sphere. Larger values result in
% greater concentration of the distribution in the mean direction mu.
%
% The remaining parameters are as for the Matlab function rand (q.v.).  The
% result may be scalar, vector, matrix or array depending on the parameters
% supplied.  Each pure quaternion returned is the result of at least two
% calls on rand, and two calls on randn, and hence randf modifies the state
% of the generator used by both rand and randn. To initialise the generator
% or control the choice of generator, use rand and/or randn.

% Note 1. The call to the internal function beta is equivalent to calling
% the Matlab statistics toolbox function betarnd(1.5,1.5) but we do not use
% betarnd to avoid dependence on the Matlab statistics toolbox, and also
% because what is needed here is a special case that can be very simply
% coded.

% Note 2. The 4-space rotation that maps (1,0,0,0) to mu is derived as
% follows, using Coxeter's Theorem 5.1 and 5.2 (see §5 of Coxeter's paper,
% especially the statement just after Theorem 5.1). The general case of a
% 4-space rotation that rotates q to p is:
%
% p = sqrt(p .* conj(q)) .* q .* sqrt(conj(q) .* p)
%
% This is obtained by taking the square root of the left and right terms of
% Coxeter's formula, in order to make the angle of rotation the same as the
% angle between p and q (whose cosine is the scalar product of p and q).
%
% In the special case used here, q = (1,0,0,0), and the formula reduces to:
%
% p = sqrt(p) .* q .* sqrt(p)
